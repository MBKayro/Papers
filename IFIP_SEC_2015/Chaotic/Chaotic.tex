\textit{Logistic} Based on earlier study in 2012, Pawel Dabal and all show us a study of HW implementation in FPGA of different chaos system as logistic and Hénon mapping and Frequency depended negative resistor FNDR. Many recent research illustrate an optimization using new methods and algorithms to have a better secure chaotic random and Area/Throutput results.

In 2014 Pawel Dabal and Ryszard Pelka, The authors propose a study of an fast Pipeline PRNG based on chaotic logistic map,and to solve the problem of the short cycle, distortion and correlation, the authors implement two version of PRNG based on simple logistic map equation using pipeline processing to have a a high operation frequency and the ability to generate sequence at different start point. The first is logLUT based on on LUT blocs and high-speed carry line of the FPGA and the second is Log DSP that use directly DSP of FPGA, however they add delays to ensure parallel sequence generation and a complex initial sequence used for a better NIST test results. As results, many configuration and tests based on delays and precision of PRNG applied to have the most combination of area, throutput and chaotic random outputs. 

In 2013, Lahcene Merah and all, demonstrate by mixing to chaotic map they can increase the security against plaintex attacks, by coupling a chaotic encryption system (ENS) based on 2-D Hénon map used to generate the chaotic sequence, and control system (CRS) based on 1-D logistic map to control a multiplexer to choose the output of ENS according to the value generated by the logistic map by XORing the MSB of 32-bit of CSR with his it neighbor LSB. The results verified a good autocorrelation, sensitivity to initial parameters. However to increase NIST test and to resist more for the attacks, they process all the outputs sequence of the system in to a logic circuit that Xor the output CSR with the output system sequence following some rules.

In 2011 Pawel Dabal and Ryszard Pelka implement two version of generator using XSG tool based on logistic mapping equation but distribute the equation Xt+1 = r*Xn(1-Xn).

\textit{Non-Linear Chaotic Dynamic} In 2013 Hariprasad and NagaDeepa, the authors demonstrating using the reseeding technique to avoid non-lineair chaotic PRNG as short-period problems, and that by mixing Reseeding module with a non-linear chaotic logistic map (CLM) using a vector mixer module based on auxiliary linear generator ALG. For each fixed point condition by comparing the Xt and Xt+1 sequence of the CLM we increase the reseeding period until it reached, and then pass the result Xt+1 sequence to vector mixing to generate the final output bu XORing it with ALG (Yt+1) OUTt+1=Xt+1[1:31] XOR Yt+1[1:31].

Du to degeneration phenomenon and for a high quality of chaotic of PRNG, In 2010 Ziqi Zhu and Hanping Hu present a new high efficiency dynamic nonlinear transform arithmetic DNT. A chaos system based on three DNT process in a parallel structure that transform input 3 times and improve a high cycle-length and distribution output sequence, and that of each DNT module initiate his 2x256 code book and obtain the binary input sequence, then transformed and look up it using inputs as parameters Bi+1= Bi(C(w)R(q)).

\textit{Spationtemporal Chaos} In 2009 Yaobin Mao and all, implement a new parallel PRNG based on digitized spatio-temporal chaos map using  coupled mapped lattice (CML) model. To achieve a high operation speed, they first deal with continuous domain with digitazed all operand to be suited for HW implementation by using and modifying a bi-directional coupled chaotic map lattice to a finite integer set. then second and to avoid finite precision chaotic map problem, they compute only the significant bit is subject to output and randomly select initial value for each lattice.

\textit{Fibonacci post-processing} In 2013, Abhinav S. Mansingka. 

This paper presents a hardware implementation of a robust non-autonomous hyperchaotic-based PRNG driven by a 256-bit LFSR. 

The original chaotic output is post-processed using a novel technique based on the Fibonacci series, bitwise XOR, rotation, and feedback.

 This paper considers a new approach to hardware post processing using XOR operation and variable rotation based on Fibonacci series through two feedback loops. chaotic output passing successfully all NIST SP. 800-22 tests. 
 
 The system is verified on a Xilinx Virtex 4 FPGA achieving throughput up to 13.165 Gbits/s for 16-bit implementations surpassing previously reported CB-PRNGs.  Digital Realization, The proposed 4-D hyperchaotic non-autonomous system is described by the following state space matrix representation of four first order ordinary differential equations. 
 
 This particular system is digitally implemented in hardware by realizing the numerical solution of the ODE. In this section, a new post processing technique is proposed that uses two rotations and XOR feedback loops: the first loop suppresses short-term predictability using a fixed rotation while the second enhances differential sensitivity using a variable rotation controlled by the Fibonacci series.
 
  Feedback Loop 1: Static Rotation Loop 1 implements a rotation and subsequent XOR in feedback. The rotation amount is fixed at 1-bit, axiomatically guaranteeing that the rotation amount and the total input width (64-bits) are relative primes. 
 
 If loop 2 is neglected, the resulting output after C cycles at the m-th bit position is. Feedback Loop 2: Variable Rotation with Fibonacci Series,  The rotation amount is specified by a Fibonacci series. 
 
 The native chaotic system suffers from short-term predictability and thus fails the tests. Post processing guarantees full output bus width passes the NIST tests. 
 
  Introducing two registers in the post processor segments the combinational logic, the XOR and the variable rotation using Fibonacci series, which reduces the delay introduced by the post processor and preserves the output to be pipelined. 
  
  While the LFSR and the proposed post processing have added a significant hardware cost.
