\textit{Phase-Locked Loop} In 2002 [TR-1] Viktor Fischer and Milos Drutarovsky, propose a analysis about extracting randomness from the jitter of the PLL implemented on Altera FPLD. Their studies is based on detecting the jitter by the sampling of the reference clock signal ($F_{CLK}$) using a correlated signal synthesized in the PLL ($F_{CLG}$) where $F_{CLG}=F_{CLK}(K_{M}/K_{D})$, and the maximum distance between the two clock (CLK,CLG) must be minimum $MAX(\Delta T_{min}) < \sigma_{jit}$. However they confirm in ideal environment condition and without jitter the sampled output or random is deterministic under a period of $T{Q}={K_{D}T_{CLK}}={K_{m}T_{CLG}}$, then they conclude in a real condition $\sigma_{jit} \neq 0 $ the randomness is not deterministic and depending on jitter distribution where the $MAX(\Delta T_{min})= T_{CLK}*GCD(2K_{M},K_{D})/4K_{M}$.  

In 2006 [TR-2] Martin Simka et al, The authors demonstrate by taking 2002 [TR-1] as model that by combined more than one PLL even parallel or series, can increase significantly sensitivity on the jitter $S=F_{CLK}MAX(\Delta T_{min})$ and the output-bit of the generator compared to the use of one PLL. The configuration of multiple PLL are based on input/output length, CVO frequency and MUL/DIV factors ($K_{M}/K_{D}$).In 2011 [TR-4] Martin Simka et al  test the impact of the the change on operation condition environment as temperature of an PLL and illustrate that with low bandwidth of PFF cause a higher number of the critical samples, decreases the output jitter and thus increase the tracking jitter. As in application, in 2008 [TR-5] Michal Varchola et al explore embedded system application of TRNG based PLL to extract randomness from the jitter and propose two version where the slower 40kbps can pass the tests.

\textit{Inverter ring oxialltor} In 2004 [TR-6] Paul Kohlbrenner et Kris Gaj and In 2009 [TR-7] Cristian Klein et al, propose a TRNG based on two ring oscillators clocked by different clock generated by an internal PLL on FPGA, and with low area implement by only one CLB slice. the authors also extract the jitter of the 2 RO using a simpler and eliminate any correlation between successive bits.

In 2003 [TR-8] K.H.Tsoi et al, propose a Hybrid implementation on FPGA of TRNG based on RO and PRNG based on BBS generators and with high operation frequency of 400Mhz. However they generate an off-chip low frequency based resistor and capacitors and it was notice they implement BBS using ALU structure that satisfies the mathematical model as squaring and modulo operation which will perform the clock cycle of each operation by $(4.5*n^{2} + n)$.

\textit{FIGARO ring oxialltor} IN 2007 [TR-9] Markus Dichtl et Jovan Dj.Golic, propose a new approach that can replace RO based on inverters and prove higher randomness using XORE combination between Fibonacci (FIRO) and Galois ring oscillators (GARO). the main key consists of a number, r, of inverters connected in a cascade together with a number of XOR logic gates forming a feedback in an analogous way where the feedback polynomial form is $f(x) = (1+x)h(x)$ where $h(1)=1$ and the result show withe the new method can achieve a stable state less than classical RO.

\textit{Self-timed ring STR} In [2013] [2011] [2013] [TR-10,11,12]Abdelkarim Cherkaoui et al, the authors propose another alternative more robust to environment (power, temperature) than RO based inverter and based on Self-Timed Ring (STR). The SRT approach consist of a ripple of L stage of FIFO as a ring $(C_{i})_{1}{_{\leq}}{_{i}}{_{\leq}}{_{L}}$ with a phase of $\Delta \varphi = T/2L$, and extract jitter of each oxillator stage using two asynchronous handshaking protocol as even that can be (taken or bubble). However and first, to have the randomness bits, that outputs $(S_{i})_{1}{_{\leq}}{_{i}}{_{\leq}}{_{L}}$ events will be samples using a flip-flop by the main clock and the result will be combined by a XOR operation $\psi = s_{1} \oplus s_{2} \oplus ... \oplus s_{L}$. Secondly, the authors suggest that to avoid the limitation frequency of the STR by the long period delay, the maximum frequency is achieve when the propagation delay (forward and reverse static delay) is near to ring accuracy (NÂ° of token and bubble) and $N_{T}/N_{B} \cong D_{ff}/_D{rr} \simeq 1$.

\textit{Metastability} In [2008] [TR-13] Ihor Vasyltsov et al, the authors present a studies of using Metastability phenomen as a entropy source generated by 5 IRO stage. They claim that by implementing the inverter as loop ring and using a Control Clock Generator to switch the connectivity between the IRO stages flowing two mode (MS, Generation), the output voltage converges to metastability level and stays longer than using bi-stable circuit (Flio-Flop) causing a high entropy. However, the authors wan to estimate the robustness of the system after applying the sampling process in a different process and environment variation modes using CMOS process and FPGA, and they find that it must added another stage for a higher quality output as decreasing the operation rate, applying a Von-Neumann post-processing and influences the loads (RC parasitic) of the last inverter, when it was noted that just post-processing is used in FPGA .

In 2011 [TR-14] Mehrdad Majzoobi et al, The authors propose a TRNG using the metastability of the flip-flop when there is a violation in setup/hold time. the system is based on closed-loop feedback mechanism for auto-adjustment on delay $\Delta$ controlled by the Programmable delay lines (PDLs) stage based on LUT to avoid violation and maintain the metastability,, however the system use at-speed monitor to keep tracking the output bit probability and proportional-integral (PI) controller to decides to add/subtract the delay difference ($\Delta \rightarrow 0$). The probability of the output is $Prob{Out = 1} = Q(\Delta/sigma)$ where $Q(x)= {1/\surd{4\Pi}}{\int{_{x}{^{\infty}}} expr{(-u^{2}/2)du}}$, where the updated/corrected delay difference is the difference between the bias/skew caused by the routing asymmetric with the delay induce by the environment condition and the correct delay injected by the PDL ($\Delta=\Delta_{p}+\Delta_{b}-\Delta_{f}$). A revision version proposed by Donggeon Lee [2014] [TR-15], to analyze the probability and maintain metastability state for a long period to avoid the deterministic state. however they use an extrat hardware resource as memory for storing the outputs and use Hamming weight to calculate the probability bits histories.
