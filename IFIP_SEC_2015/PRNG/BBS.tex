\underline{In 2012, Khushboo Sewak and all.} The main purpose of this paper is to study the FPGA implementation of two 16 bit PN sequence generator namely Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) and Blum-Blum-Shub (BBS). The use of feedback shift register permits very fast generatio PN sequence whereas BBS method requires a number of time consuming arithmetic operation as it is based on quadratic Congruential equation.
