%% Single N-Dimention CA:
In 2004 [9] Guan et al. proposed a one dimensional CA where the rule in each cell changes dynamically based upon the states of the cells within a new neighborhood of three cells . Dubbed “Self-Programmable Cellular Automata” (SPCA), the rules are switched between 90 and 165 or 150 and 105. These rules were selected because they can be easily implemented with XOR gates. Certain combinations of rules and neighborhoods were shown to produce maximal length sequences with good quality random numbers.

In 2006 Leonidas Kotoulas and al, The proposed 1-d CA is based on the real time clock sequence and used for stream cipher. The authors show that by using rules based computer times sequence as year, months to seconds can generate initial state and the length of CA cells. the initial state configuration and simultaneously the length of CA cells the product of all the above numbers, namely day, month, year, hour, min and seconds was calculated. The execution time was decided to be t = x(60 - x). The first rule arises from the product of minutes by seconds. The second rule is the number of minutes divided by the number of seconds multiplied by a constant.

Where In 2009 Ding Jun and al, implement an efficient PRNG based on the classical CA with 32 cells using rule 30 is reported and prove a high PRNG performance. 

In 2010 Ioana Dogaru and Radu Dogaru, create an automatic software tool based on Algebraic Normal Form (ANF) representation to generate an RTL code of an hybrid CA depending on ID rules. the results show by using ANF representation  $y = [K_{0} xor K_{1}(U_{1}) xor K_{2}(U_{2}) xor K_{3}(U_{3}) xor K_{4}(U_{1}*U_{2}) xor ... K_{7}(U_{1}*U_{2}*U_{3})] xor mask$ with ID=101 and 3 neighbor are identical to Matlab results.

%% Combined N-Dimention CA:
In 2003 Tkacik proposed a hardware random number generator implemented on a custom IC which combines the outputs of a CA with an LFSR. A hybrid 90/150 rules an 37 bit CA was combined with a 43-bit LFSR. This maximal length configuration combined 32 bits from the CA and LFSR to produce a maximal length RNG. It was found that the LFSR and CA must be clocked at different frequencies to create a sequence of numbers that can pass all the DIEHARD tests. Then, in 2012 Juan C.Cerda and al, notice in Tkcide [2003] the combination must be clocked at different frequency to pass all NIST test, and present another combination PRNG using HCA using 90/150 and LFSR to solve this problem. The trick is XORing the last bit of HCA with the last bit of LSFR to generate 1-bit per clock cycle, and they found the best combination for a high quality of PRNG is 37-bit LFSR with 16-bit CA. 

In 2007 Petre Anghelescu and al, propose a combination of two logic combinational circuit of Hybrid HCA where PRNG and block cipher for an encryption system, and the first HCA-1 use two rules 90/150 as a real-time key stream generator and the second HCA-1 use 51/153/195 rules. To select witch rules will be used by the block cipher HCA-2, the PRNG or HCA-1 generate an encrypting rules to switch the rules and that provide each cell has is own rules. 

2012, Jonathan M. Comer, and all, of this paper is to investigate the quality of the random numbers that can be produced using the aforementioned designs while considering the amount of resources required when implemented linear feedback shift register (LFSRs) and cellular automata (CA) on an FPGA.} This paper will focus on one-dimensional CA with each state represented by a single bit. Tkacik proposed a random number generator which combines the outputs of a CA with a LFSR [10]. A hybrid 90/150 37 bit CA was combined with a 43-bit LFSR. This maximal length configuration combined 32 bits from the CA and LFSR to produce a maximal length RNG. It was found that the LFSR and CA must be clocked at different frequencies to create a sequence of numbers that can pass all the DIEHARD tests.

In 2013, Lakshman Raut and David H. K. Hoe, use the stream ciphers. Although they were reported as passing statistical test suites, they are difficult to scale-up for arbitrary numbers of cells and it is not very clear how they can ensure a large key space. This paper explores the combination of LFSRs and CA as the key components of an efficient stream cipher based on A2U2. The main component of the stream cipher is the key stream generator, which can be viewed as a pseudo-random number generator (PRNG). The use of an NFSR instead of an LFSR improves the resistance of the cipher from various forms of cryptanalysis, such as correlation attacks and algebraic attacks [8]. The proposed stream cipher is composed of five different blocks.

In 2014, Dogaru Ioana and Dogaru Radu. Introduce Two solutions based on hybrid cellular automata (HCA) for designing cryptographically secure PRNG and Both solutions are based on hybrid cellular automata and proved to be highly efficient in terms of resources. PRNG-A corresponds to the basic HCA model with a large number of bits (63 in this case, easily extended to any arbitrary number of bits). For such large number of cells masks can be arbitrary chosen still ensuring good cryptographic properties. PRNG-B implements a chain of two HCAs and one possible choice is to have 31 cells per each HCA.
