\underline{In 2013, Shengfei Wu and al} In this paper, a hardware architecture for the generation of parallel long-period random numbers using MT19937 method was proposed. Most hardware implementations of MT19937 are straightforward non-parallelized implementations of the original C-code. The Mersenne Twister Method, which is a pseudorandom number algorithm based on a matrix linear recurrence over F2, is developed by Makoto Matsumoto in 1997. In order to get the long period and good equidistribution, the Mersenne Twister is cascaded with a tempering transform to compensate for the reduced dimensionality of equidistribution, the temper is defined in the case of Mersenne Twister. We use dual-port BRAMs in FPGA for the implementation and 3 degrees parallelization will be introduced as an example.
