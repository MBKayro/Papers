Some of the algorithms that generate pseudo random numbers are Blum Blum Shub, Inversive congruential generator, ISAAC (cipher), Lagged Fibonacci generator, Linear congruential generator, Linear feedback shift register, Mersenne twister, generalized feedback shift register (GFSR), twisted GFSR (TGFSR), Multiply-with-carry, Well-Equidistributed-Long-period Linear, Xorshift and Cellular Automata. As well as separately implementation of these structures, with use one or several of them, hybrid PRNGs can be designed. An important property of all these generators is that they are special cases of a general class of generators whose state evolves according to a (matrix) linear recurrence modulo 2 and the bits that form the output are also determined by a linear transformation modulo 2 applied to the state.
